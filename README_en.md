[Project Introduction Document (Chinese)](https://github.com/chen365409389/QueueSystem/blob/master/Doc/%E6%8E%92%E9%98%9F%E5%8F%96%E5%8F%B7%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%9F%B9%E8%AE%AD%E8%B5%84%E6%96%99.pdf)

QueueSystem is a robust, production-proven solution for intelligent queue management and customer flow optimization. Designed for high-traffic environments such as government service centers, hospitals, banks, and corporate offices, QueueSystem streamlines the entire queuing process from ticketing to service evaluation.

## üåü Key Features
- Smart queuing and calling with support for appointments, on-site ticketing, WeChat integration, green channel, service evaluation, and comprehensive data analytics
- Unified management of multiple hardware and software terminals: ticketing kiosks, hardware and software callers (hardware caller devices for confidential environments, not networked), LED displays, integrated screens, messaging and voice services
- Modular architecture: core modules use C/S architecture for performance and reliability; data services leverage Remoting (compatible with WebAPI); messaging supports Socket and WebSocket for flexible integration
- Data maintenance module uses B/S architecture with responsive MVC design, accessible on PC, tablet, and mobile devices
- Integrated display terminal uses a native Android app with embedded B/S for real-time updates and easy style management
- Highly extensible: supports custom business logic and hardware integration via open messaging protocols
- Real-time monitoring and analytics dashboards for operational insights
